# Introduction

## Main question

How important is network structure for the spreading of infectious diseases?[^weknow]

[^weknow]: We already know that it is important, but how important?

In this study, we will look into key epidemiological measurements as a function of network feature.

## A simple example

- The reproduction number $R_0$ is a key epidemiological measurement.

- It is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual.

- R0 is used by public health officials to determine the severity of an outbreak.

- Yet how does it depend on network structure?

## A simple example: small world model

- Consider a simulation using the small world model.

- In the case of no rewiring, the network is a regular lattice.

- Under this scenario, we can compute the reproduction number analytically.

- The problem: the analytical solution doesn't align with the expectation.


---

- Under the small-world network model, the reproduction number is expected to be 1.

- Yet, contrary to what we would expect, the disease spreads very quickly.

- This simple observation suggests we should be careful about what R0 tells us.

---

- To test this, we conducted a large simulation study looking into the following epidemiological measurements:

    - Reproductive number.
    - Dispersion parameter.
    - Attack rate.
    - Peak prevalence.
    - Peak time.
    - Final size.
    - Duration of the outbreak.

# Simulation Study

## Setup

- We have a population of 1000 individuals.

- We have a disease that is transmitted by contact.

- We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered [SEIR] model.

- For each SEIR simulation we:

    a. We generated a network with a given set of parameters.

    b. We simulated the disease outbreak on the network.

    c. We computed the epidemiological measurements.


## Preliminary results

## Discussion

- We care about networks.

- Different networks have different effects the spreading of infectious diseases.

- We need to understand how network structure affects epidemiological measurements.

- We developed a simulation study to look into this question.

- We found that network structure has a significant effect on epidemiological measurements.
