- Rt > 1: Epidemic grows.
- Rt < 1: Epidemic shrinks.

**Why?**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- In Agent-Based Models the network structure is a key component.

- Understanding **how network structure affects epidemiological measurements** will help us understand how to design **better models**.

# Simulation Study

## Setup

<!-- Diagram with setup: ergm -> all other graphs -->

- To test this, we conducted a large simulation study looking into the following epidemiological measurements:

    - Reproductive number.
    - Peak prevalence.
    - Peak time.
    - Generation time


- We have a population of 1000 individuals.

- We have a disease that is transmitted by contact.

- We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered [SEIR] model.

- For each SEIR simulation we:

    a. We generated a network with a given set of parameters.

    b. We simulated the disease outbreak on the network.

    c. We computed the epidemiological measurements.

## Simulation paramters

- Recovery rate: $1/7$ (one week's worth).

- Mean degree: 14 (contact rate).

- Reproductive number of ~2.

- Transmission rate of ~0.023.[^tratecomputation]

- 100 days

<!-- $RepNum = C_{rate} \times p_t\sum_{k = 0}(1 - p_r)(1 - p_t) = \frac{C_rate}{1 - (1 - p_r)(1 - p_t)}p_t$

RepNum = 2 and $p_r = 1/7$

Therefore, -->

[^tratecomputation]: To calculate the transmission rate, we use the following formula: $p_t = \frac{p_r}{(C/R + p_r - 1)}$, with C = 14, R = 2, and $p_r = 1/7$

## Discussion

- We care about networks.

- Different networks have different effects the spreading of infectious diseases.

- We need to understand how network structure affects epidemiological measurements.

- We developed a simulation study to look into this question.

- We found that network structure has a significant effect on epidemiological measurements.
